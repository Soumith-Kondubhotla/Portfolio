              The Bankist App is a fictional, minimalist banking application that
              provides users with a realistic experience of managing accounts. It
              was developed as part of a JavaScript course and focuses on
              simulating key banking operations such as logging in, transferring
              money between accounts, requesting loans, and viewing transaction
              histories.

              Mapty is a location-based workout tracking application designed to
              help users log and visualize their outdoor workout activities,
              such as running and cycling, on an interactive map.
              This project leverages the power of geolocation and local storage to
              provide a seamless experience for users to monitor and keep track of
              their fitness progress over time. Geolocation Integration:
              Automatically detects and logs the user’s current location using the
              browser’s geolocation API. Interactive Map: Displays the user's
              workouts directly on a map (using Leaflet.js), allowing them to
              visualize where each activity took place. Custom Workouts: Allows
              users to choose between running or cycling workouts, input key
              workout data (distance, duration, etc.), and logs this information.
              Data Persistence: Workout data is saved in the browser's local
              storage, ensuring that user information persists even after the page
              is refreshed. Custom Pop-ups: Provides dynamic pop-ups on the map to
              display workout details, including the type of activity, distance,
              and time. Responsive Design: Adaptable across various devices
              ensuring a smooth user experience whether on desktop or mobile.

              The Pig game is a two-player dice game where the goal is to be the first to reach 20 points. 
              Players take turns rolling a 6-sided die, accumulating points for each roll. If a player rolls 
              a 1, their turn ends, and their turn score resets to zero; otherwise, they can choose to keep 
              rolling or hold to add their turn score to their total score. The game involves balancing risk 
              (rolling again) and safety (holding). The first player to reach or exceed 20 points wins.
